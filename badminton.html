        <h2>
            <p>Badminton. The game is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in
                Gloucestershire ,
                England,
                where it was first played about 1873. The roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and
                India,
                and
                it is closely related to the old childrenâ€™s game battledore and shuttlecock.Badminton is a racquet sport
                played
                using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams, the most
                common
                forms
                of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side).
                Badminton is
                often
                played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular
                indoor
                court.
                Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side's
                half of
                the
                court.</p>
            <p>
                Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. Play ends once the
                shuttlecock
                has
                struck the floor or if a fault has been called by the umpire, service judge, or (in their absence) the
                opposing
                side.</p>
            <p>
                The shuttlecock is a feathered or (in informal matches) plastic projectile which flies differently from
                the
                balls
                used in many other sports. In particular, the feathers create much higher drag, causing the shuttlecock
                to
                decelerate more rapidly. Shuttlecocks also have a high top speed compared to the balls in other racquet
                sports.
                The
                flight of the shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive nature.</p>
            <p>
                The game developed in British India from the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock. European play
                came
                to
                be
                dominated by Denmark but the game has become very popular in Asia, with recent competitions dominated by
                China.
                Since 1992, badminton has been a Summer Olympic sport with four events: men's singles, women's singles,
                men's
                doubles, and women's doubles, with mixed doubles added four years later. At high levels of play, the
                sport
                demands excellent fitness: players require aerobic stamina, agility, strength, speed, and precision. It
                is
                also
                a
                technical sport, requiring good motor coordination and the develop1ment of sophisticated racquet
                movements.
