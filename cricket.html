                <h1>Cricket</h1>
                <h2>
                    <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the
                        centre
                        of which is a 20-metre (22-yard) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails
                        balanced
                        on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the
                        bat, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this and dismiss each player (so they
                        are
                        "out"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the
                        bails, and by the fielding side catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits
                        the
                        ground. When ten players have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The
                        game is
                        adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches.
                        They
                        communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information.</p>


                    <p> Historically, cricket's origins are uncertain and the earliest definite reference is in
                        south-east
                        England in the middle of the 16th century. It spread globally with the expansion of the British
                        Empire, leading to the first international matches in the second half of the 19th century. The
                        game's governing body is the International Cricket Council (ICC), which has over 100 members,
                        twelve
                        of which are full members who play Test matches. The game's rules are held in a code called the
                        Laws
                        of Cricket which is owned and maintained by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London. The sport
                        is
                        followed primarily in the Indian subcontinent, Australasia, the United Kingdom, southern Africa
                        and
                        the West Indies, its globalisation occurring during the expansion of the British Empire and
                        remaining popular into the 21st century.[1] Women's cricket, which is organised and played
                        separately, has also achieved international standard. The most successful side playing
                        international
                        cricket is Australia, which has won seven One Day International trophies, including five World
                        Cups,
                        more than any other country and has been the top-rated Test side more than any other country.

                <h1>Best Cricketer In India</h1>
                <h2>Sachin Tendulkar</h2>
                <h2>
                    <p>He has all the records that every cricketer dreams of. He is called the Master of Cricket or
                        rather
                        say the "God Of Cricket". Starting his career in the age of 16, he became the youngest player to
                        debut for India in Tests at the age of 16 years and 205 days.</p>

                    <p> He is the only player to have scored one hundred international centuries, the first batsman to
                        score
                        a double century in a One Day International, the only player to complete more than 30,000 runs
                        in
                        international cricket. In 2002, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack ranked him the second greatest Test
                        batsman of all time, behind Don Bradman, and the second greatest ODI batsman of all time, behind
                        Viv
                        Richards.</p>

                    <p>He has won many awards in his cricketing career. These include Arjuna Award, Rajiv Gandhi Khel
                        Ratna, Padma Shri and the Padma Vibhushan Award. Moreover he is the youngest recipient to date
                        and
                        the first ever sportsperson to receive the Bharat Ratna Award, India's highest civilian award.

                <h1>Best Cricketer In The World</h1>
                <h2>
                    <P>India skipper Virat Kohli and opener Rohit Sharma ended the year on a glorious note after
                        remaining
                        static at the first and second position in the ICC ODI rankings for batsmen. While Kohli has 887
                        points to his name, Rohit followed him with 873 points.</P>

                    <P> Rohit Sharma amassed 2,442 runs across formats in 2019. The dashing Mumbai batsman also
                        surpassed
                        Sri Lankan great Sanath Jayasuriya's 22-year-old record for most runs as an opener in a calendar
                        year across formats.</P>
                    <P>
                        Earlier on Sunday, Rohit was also named Man of the Series as India chased down 316 to win the
                        three-match ODI rubber against the West Indies 2-1 in Cuttack as the opener contributed with a
                        valiant 63-run knock.</P>
                    <p>
                        Meanwhile, Windies opener Shai Hope also entered the top 10 of the rankings after showing fine
                        form
                        in the three-match series against India.</p>

                    <p>The wicketkeeper-batsman gained five places to reach the ninth position after scoring 222 runs in
                        the series including an unbeaten 102 in the opening match in Chennai, which his side won before
                        going down in Visakhapatnam and Cuttack.</p>

                    <p> Hope's teammate Shimron Hetmyer jumped six places to be at the 19th spot while Nicholas Pooran
                        vaulted 33 places to be at the 30th position in the rankings.</p>
