                    Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a
                    goal.
                    Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where
                    the
                    word is used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in some
                    countries); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian
                    rules
                    football; rugby football (either rugby league or rugby union); and Gaelic football. These various
                    forms of football are known as football codes.</p>
                <p>
                    There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many
                    different parts of the world. Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the
                    codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th century. The expansion of
                    the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside
                    the
                    directly controlled Empire. By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already
                    developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional
                    football games in order to maintain their heritage. In 1888, The Football League was founded in
                    England, becoming the first of many professional football competitions. During the 20th century,
                    several
                    of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.

            <h2>Sunil Chhetri</h2>
            <h2>
                <p>
                    Born on 3 August 1984, Sunil Chhetri is one of India’s best produce in the world of football. The
                    striker is a captain to both the Indian national football team and the Indian Super League side
                    Bengaluru FC. With almost a million followers on Instagram, he is famously known as Captain
                    Fantastic.

                    Chhetri scored the 2nd highest number of goals in international matches among active players after
                    Cristiano Ronaldo. Also the most-capped player and top goalscorer for the Indian national team, with
                    67
                    goals in 107 matches.</p>
                <p>
                    Last year, his twitter message aimed at attracting football fans to stadium was well received and
                    appreciated".Sunil Chhetri (born 3 August 1984) is an Indian professional footballer who plays as a
                    striker or winger and captains both the Indian Super League side Bengaluru and the Indian national
                    team. Popularly known as Captain Fantastic, having scored the second highest number of goals in
                    international matches among active male players after Cristiano Ronaldo, he is both the
                    most-capped player and all-time top goalscorer for the Indian national team, with 72 goals
                    in 115 appearances. He is the current captain of the national team. Sunil Chhetri was named an
                    'Asian Icon' by AFC on his 34th birthday.</p>
                <p>
                    Chhetri began his professional career at Mohun Bagan in 2002. He then moved to JCT where he
                    scored 21 goals in 48 games. He signed for the Kansas City Wizards of Major League Soccer in
                    2010, becoming the third player from the subcontinent of note to go abroad. However, that stint
                    in the United States did not last long and soon he was back in India's I-League where he played for
                    Chirag United and Mohun Bagan before going back abroad. This time he was signed by Sporting Clube de
                    Portugal of the Primeira Liga where he played for the club's reserve side.</p>

            <h1>The Best Football Player In The World</h1>
            <h2>Lionel Messi</h2>
            <h2>
                <p>For nearly 10 years, we have been asked the question “Ronaldo or Messi?.. Lionel Messi is sometimes
                    referred to by Maradona in the discussion of who is the best in history in a more raucous voice. But
                    let’s think calmly and put our hands in what is called a conscience. Lionel Messi is definitely the
                    best. He has always been a very talented, intelligent, creative and highly influential player. For
                    Zidane, we can underline the promise of “we will understand its value after many years” when it
                    comes to
                    Messi. Because he has made everything so normal that even the most ordinary goal scored can be a
                    career
                    goal for a football player. Years later, when no one like him comes, we will understand how lucky we
                    are
                    to remember Lionel Messi’s career from day to day.</p>
