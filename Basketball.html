            <h1 style="text-align: center;">Basketball</h1>
            <h2>
                <p>Basketball is a team sport where two teams, usually consisting of five players on each team, play
                    against
                    each other on a rectangular court. The objective is to get the ball through a hoop mounted high on a
                    backboard on the opponent's side of the court, while preventing the opponent from shooting it into
                    your
                    team's hoop. It is a very popular sport worldwide, played with a round and usually
                    orange(orange-brown) ball
                    that bounces. Basketball players mainly use skills such as dribbling, shooting, running, and
                    jumping. Each
                    made basket is worth two points, while a basket made from beyond the three-point line is worth three
                    points.
                    If a player gets into too much physical contact, they may be given free throws which are worth one
                    point
                    each. The game typical lasts for four quarters and the team with the most points that the end of the
                    four
                    quarters win the game. If the score is tied at the end of the game, there will be something called
                    overtime,
                    which is additional play time to allow one team to win the match.</p>

                <p>The game is played between men's teams or between women's teams. Basketball has been played in the
                    Summer
                    Olympic Games since 1936. The shot clock rule started in 1954. The first basketball game took place
                    in 1892,
                    where the court was half the size of what it is today.In 1891 the game was invented by James
                    Naismith.

            <h2>Satnam Singh</h2>
            <h2>
                <p>In early 2010, it was announced that the global sports marketing business IMG was partnering with
                    Reliance Industries, the largest corporation in India, to form a new company known as IMG Reliance
                    (IMGR). They formed a new sports and entertainment marketing company and made their first move by
                    signing a 30-year contract with the Basketball Federation of India (BFI). The decision was an
                    attempt at
                    improving the facilities and leagues in the country and they started allowing athletes to attend the
                    Bradenton-based IMG Academy on a full scholarship.</p>

                <p>Singh led the Punjab state youth team to a national championship in June 2010, leading the BFI to
                    choose
                    him to play at an NBA Basketball Without Borders camp in Singapore. The BFI's head coach, Harish
                    Sharma,
                    had him play against members of the Indian national team, and he managed to compete with them.
                    Sharma
                    recommended Singh for IMGR to consider him for a scholarship, but at 14 years of age, he was too
                    old.
                    Sharma said, "This boy, you will want to see. I've told people many times, he can become India's Yao
                    Ming."Troy Justice, who directed basketball operations for the NBA in India, also visited Punjab and
                    discovered Singh at the NBA Mahindra Challenge. He said, "First time I saw him play, he was wearing
                    shoes that were falling apart. The seams had split, and he was coming right out of them. That's all
                    he
                    had. He was growing so fast. We helped him get shoes. I've heard people talk, but we're not sure
                    they
                    know how big he'll get." Justice had confidence in him, however, saying, "He can be the chosen one
                    for basketball in India."</p>

                <p>Nevertheless, Singh was later awarded a scholarship under the IMGR basketball training academy and
                    shifted to Bradenton, Florida in September 2010. Despite knowing no English at the time, he was one
                    of
                    29 student-athletes—male and female combined—to be selected to train at IMG Academy. During the
                    2014–15 season, he averaged 9.2 points, 8.4 rebounds and 2.2 blocks in less than 20 minutes per game
                    for
                    IMG, the No. 2 ranked team in the country.However, due to his poor English and lack of American
                    citizenship, Singh was ineligible for the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).

            <h1 style="text-align: center;">Best Basketball Player In The World</h1>
            <h2>Michael Jordan</h2>
           </p><h2><p>Michael Jeffrey Jordan (born February 17, 1963), also known by his initials MJ, is an American former
                professional basketball player and the principal owner of the Charlotte Hornets of the National
                Basketball Association (NBA). He played 15 seasons in the NBA, winning six championships with the
                Chicago Bulls. His biography on the official NBA website states: "By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the
                greatest basketball player of all time." He was on of the most effectively marketed athletes of his
                generation and was considered instrumental in popularizing the NBA around the world in the 1980s and
                1990s.<p>

               <p>Jordan played three seasons for coach Dean Smith with the North Carolina Tar Heels. As a freshman, he
                was a member of the Tar Heels' national championship team in 1982. Jordan joined the Bulls in 1984 as
                the third overall draft pick. He quickly emerged as a league star and entertained crowds with his
                prolific scoring. His leaping ability, demonstrated by performing slam dunks from the free throw line in
                Slam Dunk Contests, earned him the nicknames Air Jordan and His Airness. He also gained a reputation for
                being one of the best defensive players in basketball. In 1991, he won his first NBA championship
                with the Bulls, and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993, securing a "three-peat".
                Although Jordan abruptly retired from basketball before the beginning of the 1993–94 NBA season, and
                started a new career in Minor League Baseball, he returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and led them to
                three additional championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998, as well as a then-record 72 regular-season wins
                in the 1995–96 NBA season. Jordan retired for a second time in January 1999, but returned for two more
                NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the Washington Wizards.</p></h2>
