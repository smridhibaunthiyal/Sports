                    Roller skating is the traveling on surfaces with roller skates. It is a form of recreational
                    activity as
                    well as a sport, and can also be a form of transportation. In fact, as the United States readied for
                    World
                    War II, the government entertained the notion to add roller skates as essential equipment to move
                    infantry
                    around Europe to save gas. Skates generally come in three basic varieties: quad roller skates,
                    inline
                    skates
                    or blades and tri-skates, though some have experimented with a single-wheeled "quintessence skate"
                    or
                    other
                    variations on the basic skate design. In America, this hobby was most popular first between 1935 and
                    the
                    early 1960s and then in the 1970s, when polyurethane wheels were created and disco music oriented
                    roller
                    rinks were the rage and then again in the 1990s when in-line outdoor roller skating, thanks to the
                    improvement made to inline roller skates in 1981 by Scott Olson, took hold.</p>

            <h1 style="text-align: center;">The Best Skater In India</h1>
            <h2>Anup Kumar Yama</h2>
            <h2>Anup started skating at the age of four and is coached by his father Mr Veeresh Yama, who was a
                skater
                himself and is now a judge at the national level. Yama practices at the Indira Gandhi rink in
                Domalguda
                and has won several national titles.

                Born on 1 September 1984 in a family of athletes, as a second-generation performer, he is now
                ranked the
                first in the world in the ‘Inline Artistic Roller Skating’ category at the recently concluded
                2013 58th
                World Artistic Roller Skating Championship in Taiwan.

                After winning the bronze medal in the 57th World Artistic Roller Skating Championship 2012,
                which was
                held in New Zealand, he headed straight to the 15th Asian Roller Skating Championship in Hefei,
                China.
                It was held from 23 to 31 October, and he won three gold medals and two silver medals. This
                achievement
                surpassed his previous Asian Championship achievement of three gold medals and two bronze medals
                which
                was the highest number of medals ever won by a single skater in the Asian Championship Artistic
                Skatin
                event. He is the record-holder for most medals ever won by an artistic skater in Asia at a
                single Asian
                Championship.

                The medals won by Yama at the 15th Asian Roller Skating Championship are as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>One gold medal in Senior Men’s Freestyle Quad Artistic Skating</li>
                    <li>One gold medal in Senior Men’s Figure Artistic Skating</li>
                    <li> One gold medal in Senior Men’s Combined Artistic Skating</li>
                    <li>One silver medal in Men’s Inline Figure Artistic Skating</li>
                    <li>One silver medal in Men’s Solo Dance Artistic Skating</li>
                </ul>
                His obsesion towards this sport and years of work have made him the only Indian to win:
                <ul>
                    <li> 80 gold medals at the district level</li>
                    <li> 80 gold medals at the national level</li>
                    <li> Eight gold medals, five silver medals and nine bronze medals at the Asian level</li>
                    <li> One bronze medal and one gold medal at the world level</li>
                    <li> He is the only skater in India to participate in more than 10 World Championships and
                        has a
                        unique</li>
                    <li>distinction of being ranked number one in India, first in Asia and first in the entire
                        world.
                    </li>

                    <li> He visits Italy every year to fine tune his skating techniques, receiving assistance
                        from
                        international coaches of repute.</li>

            <H2 style="color:white;"> Mo Sanders</H2>
            <p>
            <h3 style="color: white;">Mo Sanders (born 1971), known as Quadzilla L.K. or simply Quadzilla, is an American roller skater, who
                has competed at international level in roller derby and aggressive inline skating, and national level in
                jam skating.</p>

                <p>
                Sanders was born in Tacoma, Washington, USA. His father often rollerskated to work, and Sanders spent
                much of his spare time at the local roller rink. Although largely self-taught, he was also coached by
                Lann Werner, a champion artistic roller skater. He acquired the nickname "Lanny's Kid", the initials of
                which appear in his derby name.</p>

                <p></p>>
                Sanders began skating on inline skates in 1991, and became a professional aggressive inline skater in
                1993, competing in the X Games. In the late 1990s, Sanders spent time skating in California,
                particularly at Venice Beach, and while there he heard about auditions for RollerJam, a television show
                based around banked track roller derby.[1] On the show, he was known for his multicolored hair, and for
                his acrobatic moves. He later claimed that the staged nature of the show "sucked" and he believed
                that it proved unsuccessful because "there was too much drama, too much scripting".</p>
                    <p>
                By late 2001, Sanders was back in Seattle and attracted attention for break dancing on skates. By
                2005, he was part of the "Quad Express" jam skating team, who reached the national finals of the Roll
                Bounce Championship. He subsequently performed at the Hollywood opening of the Roll Bounce film, and
                this led to involvement with Enchanted, in which he appeared and for which he choreographed much of the
                skating.</h3>
