    <h2 style="text-align: center; background-color: purple; font-size: 30px;"> What are sports</h2>
    <p style="background-color: purple;">People think of sports as physical activities but i think they are small exercises focusing specifically on a body part
        for examle skating and football increase the strength of your legs and badmintin helps your hand a eye cordinatation.
        Each sport has a beauty of its own ,some people think meditation is magical but for me sports has a better connection
        with me.A shuttle touching the badmintin racqet or the football rolling and waiting for your kick or the feeling of the 
        wind touching your face while you skate breathing that fresh air.That may not be meditation but for a person like me that
        may be even better.The bouncing of the basketball, nobody but and that ball on the court when that ball goes through the hoop 
        everything makes sence or the feeling of a bat and a ball make a game that has changed the nation makes you feel proud of
         saying that I play a sport and I give it my all.</p>

     <h2 style="text-align: center;background-color: purple;">What is my favourite sport</h2>
     <p style="background-color: purple;">Asking me which is my favourite sport is like asking me who is my favourite person from my family they all are different in their
    own way but I have a passion for skating that still burns in me and I never lose it. started skating when I was just 4 years old.
    My family pushes me to never give up anything until they know I have given my all and thanks to them I am proud to call myself
    a profetional skater.I am happy when i put on my skates i feel like a free bird that is flying up above I dont need anything when i am
    skating i m happy and satisfyied with myself and don't need anything.</p>
